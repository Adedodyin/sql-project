# SQL-projects
**A collection of SQL projects I have worked on**: 

* World's Oldest Existing Business: The aim of this analysis was to gain insight into the businesses of the world and how far back humans have been driving innovation across continents. 

* X FKA Twitter Blue Earnings: The business task was to analyze personal Twitter data to find trends in tweet patterns and how personal Twitter account is used. The problem was how trends identified from tweet patterns be utilized in future tweets to earn revenue from Twitter Blue. This analysis was carried out with datasets downloaded from my personal Twitter Analytics account, cleaned, manipulated, and analyzed with SQL and Microsoft Excel.
